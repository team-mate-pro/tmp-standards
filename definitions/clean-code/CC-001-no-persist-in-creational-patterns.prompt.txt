Check if the codebase follows CC-001: No Persistence in Creational Patterns.

RULE: Factory and Builder classes must NOT call persist(), flush(), or save() methods. They should only create and return objects. Persistence must be handled by UseCase or higher layer.

SEARCH FOR VIOLATIONS:
1. Find all classes ending with "Factory" or "Builder"
2. Check if they inject EntityManagerInterface, ObjectManager, or *RepositoryInterface
3. Check if they call: persist(), flush(), save(), add(), or store() methods

CORRECT PATTERN:
- Factory/Builder creates object and returns it
- UseCase calls factory, then calls repository->save()

VIOLATION PATTERN:
- Factory/Builder injects EntityManager or Repository
- Factory/Builder calls persist/flush/save inside create/build method

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- List files that violate the standard with line numbers
- Show the problematic code snippet
- Mark as PASS if no violations found
