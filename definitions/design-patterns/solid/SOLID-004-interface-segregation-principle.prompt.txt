Check if the codebase follows SOLID-004: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).

RULE: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Prefer small, role-specific interfaces over large "fat" interfaces. A class implementing many unrelated interfaces is a red flag.

SEARCH FOR VIOLATIONS:
1. Find classes that implement more than 3-4 interfaces (excluding framework/marker interfaces)
2. Look for interfaces with more than 5 methods - potential fat interfaces
3. Find interface methods that are implemented as empty bodies or throw "not implemented/supported" exceptions
4. Look for a single repository class implementing both CRUD and statistical/reporting interfaces
5. Check if consumers depend on large interfaces but only use 1-2 methods from them

INDICATORS OF VIOLATION:
- class Foo implements A, B, C, D, E, F, G (many unrelated interfaces)
- throw new \BadMethodCallException('Not implemented') in an interface method
- Interface has method groups that serve different concerns
- Repository implementing both write (save/delete) and read/stats interfaces

CORRECT PATTERN:
- Interfaces with 1-4 focused methods
- Separate interfaces per role/concern
- CQRS: separate read interfaces (queries) from write interfaces (commands)
- Consumers depend only on the interface they actually use

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- List files that violate the standard with line numbers
- Show the interface list or fat interface definition
- Explain which interfaces/methods are unrelated
- Mark as PASS if no violations found
