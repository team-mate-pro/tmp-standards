Check if the codebase follows SOLID-002: Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

RULE: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. Avoid switch/if-else chains that dispatch behavior based on type, action, or status. Use polymorphism, strategy pattern, or handler registries instead.

SEARCH FOR VIOLATIONS:
1. Find switch statements that dispatch to different methods based on a string/enum value
2. Find if-else chains (3+ branches) that check types, statuses, or actions to select behavior
3. Look for methods with multiple str_contains/preg_match checks mapping values to types
4. Find Command classes that use switch on an "action" argument
5. Look for services that build results conditionally based on customer/entity type

INDICATORS OF VIOLATION:
- switch($action) { case 'create': ... case 'update': ... }
- if ($type === 'foo') { ... } elseif ($type === 'bar') { ... }
- Multiple str_contains() checks returning different mapped values
- Conditional blocks that would need modification to add new behavior

CORRECT PATTERN:
- Handler registry: iterable<HandlerInterface> with supports() method
- Strategy pattern: interface with multiple implementations
- Map-based approach: array/config mapping values to results
- Enum methods: behavior encapsulated in enum cases

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- List files that violate the standard with line numbers
- Show the problematic code snippet
- Suggest which pattern would fix the violation
- Mark as PASS if no violations found
