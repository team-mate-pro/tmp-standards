Check if the codebase follows SOLID-003: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).

RULE: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering correctness. Subclasses/implementations must honor the contract (preconditions, postconditions, invariants) of their parent type/interface.

SEARCH FOR VIOLATIONS:
1. Find classes that implement interfaces but throw "not implemented" or "not supported" exceptions
2. Look for method overrides that weaken postconditions (e.g., returning null/empty where parent guarantees a value)
3. Find subclasses that throw unexpected exception types not declared in the parent
4. Look for classes implementing many unrelated interfaces (>5), making substitution impractical
5. Check for instanceof/get_class checks on interface-typed parameters (signals broken substitutability)

INDICATORS OF VIOLATION:
- throw new \RuntimeException('Not implemented') in an interface method
- Returning empty/null where the interface documents a non-null return
- Catching a parent's declared exception and throwing a different one
- A single class implementing interfaces from unrelated domains
- Using instanceof checks to determine which "real" implementation was passed

CORRECT PATTERN:
- Every interface implementation honors the full contract
- Exceptions match what the interface declares
- Return values match documented postconditions
- Interfaces are small and cohesive (see also ISP)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- List files that violate the standard with line numbers
- Show the problematic code snippet
- Explain how the contract is broken
- Mark as PASS if no violations found
