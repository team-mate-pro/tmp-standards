Check if the codebase follows SOLID-005: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

RULE: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces). Constructor parameters should use interfaces, not concrete classes. Avoid using EntityManager directly in controllers and services.

SEARCH FOR VIOLATIONS:
1. Find constructor parameters that type-hint concrete classes instead of interfaces (especially repositories and services)
2. Look for direct usage of EntityManagerInterface::getRepository() in controllers or services
3. Find services that inject HttpClientInterface directly with API config values (apiToken, baseUrl) instead of using an API client abstraction
4. Look for "new" keyword used to instantiate service/repository objects inside other classes
5. Check controllers that inject concrete repository classes instead of repository interfaces

INDICATORS OF VIOLATION:
- __construct(private OrderRepository $repo) instead of __construct(private OrderRepositoryInterface $repo)
- $this->entityManager->getRepository(SomeEntity::class)->findBy(...)
- Constructor with mix of service interfaces and raw config strings (apiToken, baseUrl, departmentId)
- new SomeService() inside a method instead of constructor injection

CORRECT PATTERN:
- All service/repository dependencies injected via interfaces
- EntityManager usage confined to repository classes only
- API client details behind an abstraction (e.g., ExternalInvoiceClientInterface)
- Configuration grouped into value objects, not scattered as constructor parameters

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- List files that violate the standard with line numbers
- Show the problematic constructor or method
- Suggest which interface should replace the concrete dependency
- Mark as PASS if no violations found
