Check if the codebase follows SOLID-001: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

RULE: Each class should have only one reason to change. Classes must not mix unrelated concerns such as persistence, notifications, external API integration, template management, and business logic.

SEARCH FOR VIOLATIONS:
1. Find classes with more than 300 lines or more than 15 public methods - potential god classes
2. Look for entity classes that contain fields/methods for multiple unrelated domains (e.g., Fakturownia sync fields in an Order entity)
3. Find service classes that handle multiple notification types or multiple unrelated operations
4. Look for classes with many unrelated constants (e.g., templates for messages AND invoices AND attachments)
5. Check for classes using multiple traits that represent different concerns

INDICATORS OF VIOLATION:
- Class has methods grouped by different concerns (e.g., sendMessage*, sendAttachment*, sendInvoice*)
- Entity has fields for external system sync (e.g., fakturowniaId, syncedAt) alongside core domain fields
- Class handles both reading and writing for unrelated features
- Multiple groups of constants serving different purposes

CORRECT PATTERN:
- One class = one concern = one reason to change
- Entity contains only its domain data and invariants
- External system integration in dedicated services
- Notification types split into separate services

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- List files that violate the standard with line numbers
- Show the problematic code snippet
- Explain which multiple responsibilities were detected
- Mark as PASS if no violations found
