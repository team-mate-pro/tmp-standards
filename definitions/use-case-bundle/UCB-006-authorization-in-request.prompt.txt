Check if the codebase follows UCB-006: Authorization Must Be Handled in Request Class.

RULE: Authorization checks must be in Request class via securityCheck() method, NOT in Controller. Controllers must NOT call denyAccessUnlessGranted() or perform manual security checks.

SEARCH FOR VIOLATIONS:

1. Find all Controller classes extending AbstractRestApiController
2. Check controller methods for forbidden calls:
   - $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted()
   - $this->security->isGranted()
   - $this->isGranted()
3. If controller has authorization calls, check if the corresponding Request class has securityCheck() method
4. Flag any controller with inline authorization checks

CORRECT PATTERN:
- Request class extends AbstractDecoratedRequest or AbstractValidatedRequest
- Request class implements securityCheck(): bool method
- securityCheck() calls $this->security->isGranted(Permission::*, [...subjects])
- Controller action receives Request and UseCase, calls UseCase, returns response
- Controller has NO authorization logic

VIOLATION PATTERN:
- Controller calls $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted(Permission::*, [...])
- Controller uses $this->security->isGranted() for permission checks
- Controller throws AccessDeniedException based on permission logic
- Request class is missing securityCheck() method while controller has auth checks

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- List Controller files that violate the standard with line numbers
- Show the problematic code snippet (the denyAccessUnlessGranted or isGranted call)
- Identify which Request class should have the securityCheck() method
- Provide the suggested securityCheck() implementation
- Mark as PASS if no violations found

EXAMPLE VIOLATION:
```php
// In Controller - WRONG
public function listAction(GetPendingSuggestionsHttpRequest $request, GetPendingSuggestionsUseCase $useCase): JsonResponse {
    $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted(Permission::AI_SUGGESTIONS_READ, [$request->getOrganizationId()]); // VIOLATION
    return $this->response($useCase($request));
}
```

EXAMPLE FIX:
```php
// In GetPendingSuggestionsHttpRequest - CORRECT
protected function securityCheck(): bool
{
    return $this->security->isGranted(
        Permission::AI_SUGGESTIONS_READ,
        [$this->getOrganizationId()]
    );
}

// In Controller - CORRECT (no auth code)
public function listAction(GetPendingSuggestionsHttpRequest $request, GetPendingSuggestionsUseCase $useCase): JsonResponse {
    return $this->response($useCase($request));
}
```
