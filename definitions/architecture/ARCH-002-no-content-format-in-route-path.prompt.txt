Check if the codebase follows ARCH-002: No Content Format in Route Paths.

RULE: Route paths must identify resources, not their representation format.
Content format must be negotiated via Accept header, not encoded in URL.

SEARCH FOR VIOLATIONS:
1. Find all Controller classes with #[Route] attributes
2. Check route paths for format indicators:
   - Format suffixes: -pdf, -csv, -xlsx, -xml, -html, -doc
   - Format actions: /export-csv, /download-pdf, /generate-pdf, /as-pdf, /to-csv, /generate-xlsx
   - Format sub-paths: /pdf, /csv, /excel (when referring to format, not resource)
3. Check route names for format indicators (e.g. name: 'api_order_generate_cmr_pdf')

CORRECT PATTERNS:
- POST /api/orders/{id}/cmr + Accept: application/pdf → generates CMR as PDF
- GET /api/reports/{id} + Accept: text/csv → report as CSV
- GET /api/invoices/{id} + Accept: application/pdf → invoice as PDF
- Resource sub-paths like /cmr, /invoice are valid (they identify resources, not formats)

VIOLATION PATTERNS:
- /orders/{id}/cmr-pdf (format in path)
- /api/reports/{id}/export-csv (format action in path)
- /api/invoices/{id}/download-pdf (format action in path)
- /api/settlements/{id}/generate-xlsx (format action in path)
- Route name containing format: 'api_order_generate_cmr_pdf'

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- List files with line numbers
- Show the problematic route definition
- Explain what format indicator is embedded in the path
- Suggest correct alternative using Accept header
- Mark as PASS if no violations found
