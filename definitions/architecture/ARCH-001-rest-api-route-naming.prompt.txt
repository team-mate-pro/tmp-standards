Check if the codebase follows ARCH-001: REST API Route Naming Convention.

RULE: All REST API routes must use plural nouns to represent resources. Verbs are not allowed in route paths. HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) determine the action.

SEARCH FOR VIOLATIONS:
1. Find all Controller classes with #[Route] attributes
2. Check route paths for forbidden patterns:
   - Verbs in path: /enable, /disable, /activate, /deactivate, /create, /update, /delete, /get, /find, /check, /validate, /process, /execute, /run, /start, /stop, /pay, /send, /mark, /set
   - Singular nouns where plural expected: /api/shop (should be /api/shops)
   - Action-oriented paths: /api/*/do-something
3. Check for verb-based sub-resources:
   - /api/resources/{id}/enable (should be PATCH /api/resources/{id} with payload)
   - /api/resources/{id}/disable (should be PATCH /api/resources/{id} with payload)
   - /api/resources/check-something (should be GET /api/resources/{id}/somethings)

CORRECT PATTERNS:
- GET /api/resources - list all
- GET /api/resources/{id} - get one
- POST /api/resources - create
- PUT /api/resources/{id} - replace
- PATCH /api/resources/{id} - update (including state changes via payload)
- DELETE /api/resources/{id} - delete
- GET /api/resources/{id}/sub-resources - nested collection
- PATCH /api/resources/{id} with {"status": "enabled"} - state change

VIOLATION PATTERNS:
- POST /api/shops/enable (verb in path)
- POST /api/shops/disable (verb in path)
- POST /api/settlements/{id}/pay (verb in path)
- GET /api/facilities/check-availability (verb in path)
- POST /api/products/create (redundant verb)
- GET /api/user (singular instead of plural)

CONDITIONAL USE CASE PATTERNS (ALLOWED):
- Single endpoint with multiple use cases selected by match expression
- Request DTO implementing multiple interfaces
- Payload-driven use case execution (e.g., status field determines which use case runs)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- List files that violate the standard with line numbers
- Show the problematic route definition
- Explain what verb or pattern is being used incorrectly
- Suggest the correct RESTful alternative
- Mark as PASS if no violations found
